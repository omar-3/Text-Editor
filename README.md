# Text-Editor
still in progress...</br>but It would support **at least** 
* syntax highlighting 
* searching
* line numbering
* auto-indent
* copy and paste
* vim modes

**highly** derived from Kilo editor made by THE amazing Antirez <3 and Xi-Editor... I kind of build above Kilo with some tweaks derived from Xi-Editor.
