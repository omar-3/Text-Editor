# Text-Editor
This is a simple text editor implementation in C99 without curses library. I was **heavily** _affected_ by the great Salvatore Sanfilippo (Antirez) kilo editor, and bric, and some other javascript editor which was written based on kilo but I cannot remeber where it is, but I learned from his/her node js so much and I thoroughly enjoyed his/get code.</br></br>

This code is heavily commented, and you will find a lot of resources in the comments, because C99 is **really** huge and sophisticated, now I _understand_ Linus.
